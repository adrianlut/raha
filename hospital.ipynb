    "## 6. Initializing and Updating the Error Corrector Models\n",
    "Baran initializes the error corrector models. Baran then iteratively samples a tuple. We should label data cells of each sampled tuple. It then udpates the models accordingly and generates a feature vector for each pair of a data error and a correction candidate. Finally, it trains and applies a classifier to each data column to predict the final correction of each data error. Since we already labeled tuples for Raha, we use the same labeled tuples and do not label new tuples here."
